    <p>My name is Nathan Hugon, and I am a full-stack JavaScript developer with a
    background in education as an English teacher and a love for sourdough baking.
    Initially drawn to web development as a means to share my baking knowledge,
    I strive to write code that is modular, flexible, and easy to read. An
    accompanying passion for research drives my ability to find and create solutions
    to complex problems.</p>
