    <p>This is simple app in which you can organize images into albums. Albums
    need to be created first, and then images can be added to them. Albums and
    images can also be deleted.</p>
    <p>The app was built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular,
    and Node.js), and is meant to serve as an exercise and template for a basic
    full-stack JavaScript app, rather than provide novel funtionality.</p>
